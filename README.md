Suppose you have a simple backup script, which produces a file at regular time intervals.  Then you want to save disc space and not keep all archives it produces for ever.  This is a simple python script which will allow you to do this by keeping files logarithmically separated in time, so that certain user specified criteria are satisfied.  Logarithmic spacing means that most files will be the newest, with kept copies becoming less frequent as you go further back.
